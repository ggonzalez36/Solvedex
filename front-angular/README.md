# Angular 15 Front Rest API



## Flow for User Registration and User Login
For JWT – Token based Authentication with Rest API, we’re gonna call 2 endpoints:
- POST `api/auth/signup` for User Registration
- POST `api/auth/signin` for User Login
- POST `api/auth/signout` for User Logout



Run `ng serve --port 8081` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8081/`.
